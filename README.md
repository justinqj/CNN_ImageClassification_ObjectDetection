# Customized CNN Architectures for Image Classification and Object Detection
This repository contains a project for customizing standard CNN architectures for image classification and implementing a CNN architecture for object detection and localization. We've utilized popular architectures like AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet for image classification and Faster-RCNN and YOLO for object detection.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this assessment is to demonstrate a deep understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and object detection algorithms. By customizing standard CNN architectures and implementing object detection methods, we aim to showcase our ability to develop tailored CNN architectures for various computer vision tasks.

## Objectives:
Understanding of CNNs and Object Detection Algorithms: To facilitate the learning of advanced topics for research and assist in project completion.
Development of Custom CNN Architectures: To cater to different computer vision-related tasks.

## Tasks:
Customization of Standard CNNs: Modify architectures like AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet by adjusting their layers. Train and test these customized models for image classification.
Object Detection Implementation: Utilize Faster-RCNN and SSD/YOLO architectures for object detection and localization. Existing implementations, such as the Google Object Detection API, can be used.
Training and Testing: Use the provided dataset to train and test object detection models using Faster-RCNN and SSD/YOLO methods.
